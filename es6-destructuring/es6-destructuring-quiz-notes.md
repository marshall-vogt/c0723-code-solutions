- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring is a way to access values stored in an object or array and assign them to new variables.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  The 'const' or 'let' declaration that assigns the object to new variables inside curly brackets, and inside the curly brackets is the property name, semicolon and the variable to store the value in.
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  The 'const' or 'let' declaration that assigns the array to new variables inside square brackets, and inside the square brackets are the new variables separated by commas.

  In destructuring, the name of the array or object is on the right side of the expression, and on the left side when creating.
