## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops allow us to repeat the same code for a specified amount of times.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The 'condition' determines if the loop should continue repeating and prevents an infinite loop.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  An iteration is an individual instance that a block of code is repeated.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  In a 'while' loop, the condition is checked before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  In a 'for' loop, the initialization expression is evaluated once before the loop begins.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  In a 'for' loop, the condition is checked before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The 'final' expression of a 'for' loop is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration, before the condition is evaluated.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  The 'break' keyword allows us to exit a loop.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The '++' operator adds 1 to the operand.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  The 'for..in' loop allows us to iterate through keys of an object.
