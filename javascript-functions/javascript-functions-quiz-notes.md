## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions are a tool to pack code for reuse, to simplify code reading by naming, and allowing code to handle many situations.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Defining a function includes using the keyword 'function' to create the function, naming the function, determining the list of zero or more parameters, opening the function code block, starting the code block, an optional return statement, and ending the code block.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function can be called by writing the function name followed by parantheses for comma-separated arguments.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The call only contains the function name and the arguments, whereas the definition includes the code to be executed.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is included in the definition of a function while arguments are passed to the function when calling.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters allow a variable to be used as a placeholder and then later assigned with an argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement produces a value to use in the program and ends the execution of code in the function.
